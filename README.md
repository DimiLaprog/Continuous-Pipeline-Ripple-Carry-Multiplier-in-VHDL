# Continuous-Pipeline-Ripple-Carry-Multiplier-in-VHDL
Continuous Pipeline Ripple Carry Multiplier in VHDL using Vivado Xilinx.

For code: look into code file.
#
Board Used: Zybo (xc7z010clg400-1) , Zynq-7000 product family.

## We present in the following order:
1. Circuit Design using pipeline where red lines and dots indicate the positions of extra flip flops to be used in order to achieve pipeline.
2. RTL produced by Vivado
3. Behavioral Simulation
> Note that pipeline produces correct results after 11 Clock Cycles and initial reg values are 0.

4. Critical Path Delay
5. Utilization table
